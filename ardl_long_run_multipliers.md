## Error-Correction Model

| Term | Coefficient | Std. Error | t-statistic | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Intercept | 3.216*** | 0.175 | 18.360 | <0.001 |
| Δ Real Household Consumption (log) | 0.414 | 0.294 | 1.408 | 0.167 |
| Δ Heating Degree Days (log) | 0.951*** | 0.012 | 77.059 | <0.001 |
| Error Correction Term (ECT t-1) | −0.879*** | 0.048 | −18.268 | <0.001 |

87.9% of any disequilibrium is corrected within one quarter (half-life ≈ 1/3 of a quarter).
